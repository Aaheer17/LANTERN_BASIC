/home/fa7sa/.conda/envs/torch_gpu_renew/lib/python3.11/site-packages/coffea/nanoevents/schemas/fcc.py:5: FutureWarning: In version 2025.1.0 (target date: 2024-12-31 11:59:59-06:00), this will be an error.
To raise these warnings as errors (and get stack traces to find out where they're called), run
    import warnings
    warnings.filterwarnings("error", module="coffea.*")
after the first `import coffea` or use `@pytest.mark.filterwarnings("error:::coffea.*")` in pytest.
Issue: coffea.nanoevents.methods.vector will be removed and replaced with scikit-hep vector. Nanoevents schemas internal to coffea will be migrated. Otherwise please consider using that package!.
  from coffea.nanoevents.methods import vector
printing all arguments.....
